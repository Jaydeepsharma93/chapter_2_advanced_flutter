## Date Picker:

  * A user interface element that allows users to choose a date.
  * It typically displays a calendar grid where users can tap on a specific day to select it.
  * Date pickers are commonly found in apps for booking appointments, scheduling events, or filtering data based on dates.

## Time Picker:
  * A temporary window that appears on top of the main app screen.
  * It often contains important information, requires user input, or presents a confirmation message.
  * Dialog boxes can have buttons for users to respond to the prompt, such as "OK," "Cancel," or other choices.
    
## Date Picker Cupertino (iOS):
  * A specific type of date picker designed to match the look and feel of Apple's iOS platform.
  * It offers a sleek, minimalist design with a calendar grid for selecting dates.
  * This is used by developers building apps specifically for iOS devices.
## Time Picker Cupertino (iOS):
 * Similar to the date picker, this is a time picker designed for iOS that follows the Cupertino (iOS) design language.
 * It might use rotary dials or a list for selecting hours and minutes.
 * This component is used in conjunction with the Cupertino date picker or independently for time selection within iOS apps.

## Action Sheet:
 * Another type of temporary window that appears from the bottom of the screen.
 * It typically displays a list of options for users to choose from.
 * Action sheets are often used for quick actions or providing alternative choices related to the current context in the app.
